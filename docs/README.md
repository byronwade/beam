# Beam Documentation

## Decentralized Tor Tunneling Platform

Beam is a self-hosted, decentralized tunneling platform that uses Tor hidden services and peer-to-peer networking to provide secure, private access to your local applications.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g @byronwade/beam

# Start tunneling
beam 3000 --tor

# Register a custom domain
beam register byronwade.local
```

### Key Features
