# Project Roadmap

Beam is evolving from a Tor-only tunneling tool into a universal, decentalized networking protocol. 

## Phase 1: Multi-Network Support
**Goal: Transport Agnosticism**

- **I2P Integration**: High-throughput hidden services optimized for file transfer.
- **Nym Mixnet**: Metadata privacy to protect against global passive adversaries.
- **Veilid & Libp2p**: Mobile-first P2P frameworks for direct device syncing.

## Phase 2: Performance & Connectivity
**Goal: Low Latency & High Trust**

- **WebRTC & Holepunch**: Instant, DHT-signaled direct streams for "Fast Mode" (video/gaming).
- **WireGuard Integration**: Trusted point-to-point high-speed links.

## Phase 3: Market Expansion
**Goal: New Use Cases**

- **Edge Computing**: "Serverless on User Device" architectures.
- **IoT Fleet Management**: Secure remote access for embedded devices.
- **Decentralized VPN (dVPN)**: General internet routing through the mesh.

## Phase 4: Censorship Resistance
**Goal: Unstoppable Access**

- **Pluggable Transports**: Snowflake, Meek, and Obfs4 to evade Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).
- **Nostr Relay Signaling**: Using Nostr as an unblockable signaling layer for P2P connection establishment.

## Phase 5: Decentralized Identity (DID)
**Goal: Zero-Trust Access Control**

- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**: "Friend-only" tunnels protected by verifiable credentials.
- **DIDComm**: Secure, routed messages authenticated by DID logic.

## Phase 6: Incentivized Infrastructure
**Goal: Sustainable DePIN Ecosystem**

- **Bandwidth Micropayments**: Probabilistic payments to incentivize relay node operators.
- **DePIN Verification**: Cryptographic proof-of-uptime for edge node rewards.
